# ChatGPT-OpenAI-ChatAPI
Here is an example of how you might use the OpenAI Chat API in Python to retrieve a response from the API and display it in a GUI window using the PySimpleGUI library:


This code will create a simple GUI window with a text input field and two buttons, "Send" and "Exit". When the "Send" button is clicked, the code will use the OpenAI Chat API to retrieve a response based on the message entered in the input field, and will display the response in a pop-up window using the PySimpleGUI library.

To use this code, you will need to install the OpenAI and PySimpleGUI libraries, and you will need to obtain an API key for the OpenAI API. You can do this by signing up for an OpenAI account and following the instructions for creating an API key.
